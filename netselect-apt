# A script to create an apt sources.list file automatically by downloading
# the list of Debian mirrors and choosing the fastest main and non-us server
# using netselect.
#
# Author: Avery Pennarun <apenwarr@gmail.com>
# Enhancements: Filippo Giunchedi <filippo@esaurito.net>
#
# License: public domain.  Please feel free to improve this script.  It
# doesn't really belong in the netselect package, particularly since the
# netselect package doesn't depend on wget and this script does.  If you
# feel like merging this into another package, or creating a new package,
# please do.  Then tell me, so I can remove it from the netselect package.
#
# TO DO:
#   - have some way to pass options (especially -t) to netselect.
#   - test the generated files automatically.  Some mirrors in the list
#       are broken.  We should at least verify that the Packages and Sources
#       files exist and aren't ancient.
#   - maybe generate redundant entries, in case one server is missing files?

# our defaults
# RATIONALE for WANT_SOURCES and WANT_NONFREE environmental variables:
# both variables can be system wide and can be useful to not always specify them
# on the commandline
